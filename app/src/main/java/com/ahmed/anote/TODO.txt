What happens if user editing note then minimizes? Note is lost...

Close fab menu on click anywhere on screen - no nice way of doing this...

Fix last test in NoteSelectionActivity.

Encrypt pins.

CLEAN UP:
- Create SQL interface, then DeleteAlertDialog can be made generic.
- Create EnteredValues interface.
